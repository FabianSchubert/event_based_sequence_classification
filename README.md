### Event Based Sequence Classification of Hand Gestures

This project implements an event-based network ("spiking" network) for multi-channel time series classificaion that is trained and tested on hand gestures recorded using phone accelerometer data, as described in
[Echo State Networks and Long Short-Term Memory for Continuous Gesture Recognition: A Comparative Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-020-09754-0) by Doreen Jirak, Stephan Tietz, Hassan Ali and Stefan Wermter.

It uses the [GeNN](https://github.com/genn-team/genn) library for network simulation and training on the GPU.
